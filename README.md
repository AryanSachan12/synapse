## üöÄ About the Project

**Synapse** is an intelligent healthcare web application designed to improve patient care and reduce clinical overhead using AI.

The platform features a virtual assistant that:
- Understands patient symptoms via voice/text
- Provides AI-generated preliminary advice
- Automatically schedules doctor appointments

Doctors get a full view of:
- Appointments
- Uploaded patient reports
- AI-analyzed insights to aid diagnosis

This personal hackathon project emphasizes accessibility, automation, and meaningful use of machine learning in real-world healthcare settings.
